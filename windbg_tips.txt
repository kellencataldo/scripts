!thread ouputs info about a certain thread. .thread switches the register context to the given thread

!process 0 will show stacks for all paged in kernel stacks. !process 2 will show both paged in and paged out kernel stacks.
The second choice is more useful for debugging deadlocks where a waiting thread will be paged out.
